# Netflix_Recommendation_Engine
Building a Netflix Recommendation Engine using Python in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Here we are using the Kaggle Dataset - Netflix Prize Data to download the movie_titles and combined_data_1 datasets. 
While the movie_titles containes all the movie titles the combined_data_1 containes the customer_id, movie_id, the ratings they gave to different movies and the timing-of-rating.

We are using Single Value Decomposition(SVD) Algorithm to predict the types of movies a user might like based on the movies they have given a high rating.
